This folder contains two demos

:
1. main_DCBFC.m
    This script shows how to cluster using DCBFC.

2. main_compare_diffnum.m
    This script shows how to obtain different number of clusters for DCBFC.

Note: The results of the demos are in individual level, which are different from the results in the paper.
